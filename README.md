# blackboard-fun
A project to demo the idea of the blackboard pattern.

Workers get registered in the blackboard. Each worker declares it can do a certain type of job.

When a job gets posted to the blackboard, it is responsible for finding a worker that can do the job and give it to them. If none is found the blackboard halts.

Blackboard makes sure jobs run in parallel and improve performance and logging.
